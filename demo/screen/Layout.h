/**
 * \brief An abstract class for defining items that form the layout.
 *
 * The LayoutItem class provides needed functionality to define and draw widgets,
 * which get automatically placed and sized based on the layout-item type.
 * Each item can have its own sub-items with different types.
 *
 * To update position and sizes of an item and it's sub-items, call resolve(). Call
 * draw() to draw the widgets based on positions and sizes resolve() calculated.
 * Normally, draw() is called immediately after resolve().
 *
 * \note This currently is rather basic and meant for testing bWidgets mainly. It's
 *       planned to give bWidgets its own layout-engine at some point.
 * \note We currently expect a RootLayout to be at the top of the tree. Through it
 *       the needed position and size hints can be set. Without changing these, the
 *       calculated widget-coordinates don't change.
